    "## 📚 Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this notebook, ensure you have configured Azure AI services, set the appropriate configuration parameters, and set up a Conda environment to ensure reproducibility. You can find the setup instructions and how to create a Conda environment in the [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md) file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 Table of Contents\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook guides you through the following sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [**Transcription Services**](transcription-services)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Azure AI's Speech SDK offers robust transcription services that convert spoken language into written text. This capability is useful in various scenarios, such as transcribing meetings, generating subtitles for videos, or enabling voice commands in applications. The following sections explore three different use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. [**Local Files**](#transcription-from-local-files): Learn how to transcribe audio from files stored on your machine. This is particularly useful when working with small to medium-sized files that can be easily accessed and processed locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. [**Blob Storage**](#transcription-from-blob-storage): Discover how to transcribe audio from files stored in Azure Blob Storage. This approach is ideal for larger files that require the scalability and robustness of cloud storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. [**Multi-language Auto Recognition**](#multi-language-auto-recognition-transcription): Explore the SDK's ability to automatically recognize and transcribe multiple languages within a single audio file. This feature is beneficial when dealing with multilingual content.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. [**Enable Diarization (preview)**](#enable-diarization): Run an speech-to-text transcription with real-time diarization. Diarization is the process of distinguishing between different speakers participating in a conversation. The Speech service provides information about which speaker was speaking a particular part of the transcribed speech.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. [**Real time speech to text (Streams)**](#streams): This section demonstrates how to convert speech to text from audio streams, using push streams for real-time processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details, refer to the following resources:\n",

This allows the function to automatically detect the language spoken in the audio file. Currently, the supported languages are English (United States), Spanish (Spain), and French (France). However, you can add new languages using the `transcriber_client.add_supported_language` method or by passing the `auto_detect_source_language` parameter when calling the `transcribe_speech_from_file_continuous` function.\n",
