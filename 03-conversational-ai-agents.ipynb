    "#### Setting Up Conda Environment and Configuring VSCode for Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow these steps to create a Conda environment and set up your VSCode for running Jupyter Notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Create Conda Environment from the Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "> Instructions for Windows users: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create the Conda Environment**:\n",
    "   - In your terminal or command line, navigate to the repository directory.\n",
    "   - Execute the following command to create the Conda environment using the `environment.yaml` file:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     conda env create -f environment.yaml\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - This command creates a Conda environment as defined in `environment.yaml`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Activating the Environment**:\n",
    "   - After creation, activate the new Conda environment by using:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     conda activate speech-ai-azure-services\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Instructions for Linux users (or Windows users with WSL or other linux setup): \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use `make` to Create the Conda Environment**:\n",
    "   - In your terminal or command line, navigate to the repository directory and look at the Makefile.\n",
    "   - Execute the `make` command specified below to create the Conda environment using the `environment.yaml` file:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     make create_conda_env\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Activating the Environment**:\n",
    "   - After creation, activate the new Conda environment by using:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     conda activate speech-ai-azure-services\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Configure VSCode for Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install Required Extensions**:\n",
    "   - Download and install the `Python` and `Jupyter` extensions for VSCode. These extensions provide support for running and editing Jupyter Notebooks within VSCode.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Attach Kernel to VSCode**:\n",
    "   - After creating the Conda environment, it should be available in the kernel selection dropdown. This dropdown is located in the top-right corner of the VSCode interface.\n",
    "   - Select your newly created environment (`speech-ai-azure-services`) from the dropdown. This sets it as the kernel for running your Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Run the Notebook**:\n",
    "   - Once the kernel is attached, you can run the notebook by clicking on the \"Run All\" button in the top menu, or by running each cell individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you'll establish a dedicated Conda environment for your project and configure VSCode to run Jupyter Notebooks efficiently. This environment will include all the necessary dependencies specified in your `environment.yaml` file. If you wish to add more packages or change versions, please use `pip install` in a notebook cell or in the terminal after activating the environment, and then restart the kernel. The changes should be automatically applied after the session restarts."
